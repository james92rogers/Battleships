## Overview ##

This was my first project on the General Assembly Software Engineering course, where we were tasked to make a grid based game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I selected to do Battleships, as I was excited by the challenge of programming the computer to make moves tactically (and also I used to love this game when I was a kid).

## The Brief

* Create a grid based game in the browser.
* The game must be one player, where the user battles against the computer.
* The computer must be able to randomly place its pieces at the start of the game.
* The computer should be able to make random attacks on the players board.
* Design logic for winning and losing and display this on the screen.
* Include separate HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
* Deploy your game online.
