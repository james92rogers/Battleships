## Overview

This was my first project on the General Assembly Software Engineering course, where we were tasked to make a grid based game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I selected to do Battleships, as I was excited by the challenge of programming the computer to make moves tactically (and also I used to love this game when I was a kid).
